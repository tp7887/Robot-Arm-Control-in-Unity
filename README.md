# Robot Arm Control in Unity

This project aims to simulate a 3 degree-of-freedom robot arm in unity and control it using inverse kinematics. The robot arm model is created in Solidworks, then it is exported to URDF file before imported to unity. Currently to control the robot, input the x,y,z coordinate to the Px, Py, Pz in the IK component in the Inspector, then hit enter. The end effector (the red cube) will move to the desired coordinate.
